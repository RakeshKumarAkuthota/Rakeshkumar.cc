Just about every marketer is hosting webinars these days. Using webinar software is undoubtedly one of the best ways to interact with your leads, engage with them, and move them further down the sales funnel.

However, hosting live webinars can be challenging. I’m sure we’ve all experienced either a poor internet connection, getting booted out of a meeting randomly, or forgetting to click that Record Meeting button.
